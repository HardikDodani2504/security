Hashdeep

1. To hash a file - 
● hashdeep -b -s filename
-b : don’t want to display the full path of file - 
-s : supress any error messages- 

2. apply multiple hash algorithms
● hashdeep -c md5,sha1,sha256,tiger filename

● hashdeep -c md5 *.txt
● hashdeep -c md5,sha1 *.txt

3. Hashing block of files- 
● hashdeep -c md5 -p 100 example.txt

4. recursively calculate hash (all files and subdirectories in a specified directory)
● hashdeep c md5 -r /home/shachi/myfiles

5. redirect the output of md5 hash of files to another file
● md5deep *.txt>hashset.txt
● hashdeep *.txt>hashtext1.txt

6. display output in matching mode -
● md5deep -m hashset.txt *
● hashdeep -m -k hashset1.txt *

7. supress unwanted system msgs/error - 
● md5deep -m hashset.txt *
● hashdeep -s -m hashset1.txt *

8. display all files which are negatively matching - 
● md5deep -s -x hashset.txt *
● hashdeep -s -x hashset1.txt *
