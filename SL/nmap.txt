nmap

1. TCP Connect Scan:
● Command: `nmap -sT target_ip`
- Explanation: TCP Connect Scan is a basic port scanning technique. It establishes a full connection
to each target port to determine whether it's open or closed. Open ports will complete the connection,
while closed ports will result in a refusal.

2. TCP SYN Scan:
● Command: `nmap -sS target_ip`
- Explanation: TCP SYN Scan sends SYN packets to target ports and analyses the response. If a
SYN/ACK is received, the port is open; if a RST is received, it's closed. This scan is stealthy and
doesn't complete the full connection.

3. FIN Scan:
● Command: `nmap -sF target_ip`
- Explanation: FIN Scan sends FIN packets to target ports. If the port is closed, it should respond
with a RST. However, if the port is open, it may ignore the packet. This scan can be used to identify
firewall filtering.

4. Null Scan:
● Command: `nmap -sN target_ip`
- Explanation: Null Scan sends packets with no flags set to target ports. If the port is closed, it
should respond with a RST. If it's open, it may ignore the packet. Similar to the FIN Scan, it can
identify firewall filtering.

5. XMAS Scan:
● Command: `nmap -sX target_ip`
- Explanation: XMAS Scan sends packets with multiple TCP flags set (FIN, URG, and PSH) to
target ports. Similar to Null and FIN Scans, it's used to identify filtering or state of the ports.

6. ACK Scan:
● Command: `nmap -sA target_ip`
- Explanation: ACK Scan sends packets with only the ACK flag set to target ports. It's used to detect
stateful filtering systems. If it receives an RST, the port is unfiltered.

7. Ping Sweep:
● Command: `nmap -sn target_subnet`
- Explanation: Ping Sweep scans a range of IP addresses to identify hosts that are up and responsive.
It sends ICMP echo requests to discover active hosts in the specified subnet.

8. Service and Version Detection:
● Command: `nmap -sV target_ip`
- Explanation: Service and Version Detection is used to identify the services and versions running on
open ports. Nmap sends probes to the open ports and matches responses to a database of known
services and versions.

9. Port and Port Range Scanning:
● Command: `nmap -p port(s) target_ip`
- Explanation: Port and Port Range Scanning allows you to specify single ports or ranges to scan,
helping you focus on specific services or areas of interest.

10. OS Fingerprinting:
● Command: `nmap -O target_ip`
- Explanation: OS Fingerprinting is used to identify the operating system of the target host. Nmap
analyses responses to specific probes and matches them to known OS signatures to make an educated
guess about the OS.
