RSA

Let p and q be two large prime numbers
Let N = pq be the modulus
calculate phi = (p-1)(q-1)
Choose e relatively prime to (p-1)(q-1)
Find d = ((phi . k)+1)/e #k such that d is an integer
Public key is (N,e) #e = public exponent
Private key is (N,d) #d = private exponent

To encrypt message M compute
C = M^e mod N
To decrypt C compute
M = C^d mod N
