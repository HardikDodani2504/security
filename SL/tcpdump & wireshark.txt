tcpdump & wireshark

Choosing an interface:
By default, tcpdump captures packets on all interfaces. To view a summary of available interfaces:
● tcpdump -D

Basic command for sniffing
● tcpdump -n
The -n parameter is given to stop tcpdump from resolving ip addresses to hostnames.
example:
tcpdump -v -n

Selecting packets with specific protocol
● tcpdump -n tcp
●tcpdump -n icmp

Capturing traffic from particular host or port
● tcpdump -n src 172.16.92.1
● tcpdump -n dst 172.16.92.1
● tcpdump -n port 80
● tcpdump port 80

Specific Packets from specific port
● tcpdump udp and src port 53

Observing packets within a specific port range
● tcpdump -n portrange 1-80
It shows all packets whose source or destination port is between 1 to 80
